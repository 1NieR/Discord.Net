Discord.Net
===========

Discord.Net is an unofficial C# wrapper around the `Discord chat service`.
It offers several methods to create automated operations, bots, or even custom clients.

Feel free to join us in the `Discord API chat`_.

Warning
-------

This is an alpha!

This library has been built thanks to a community effort reverse engineering the Discord client. 
As Discord is still in alpha, it may change at any time without notice, breaking this library as well.
Discord.Net itself is also in early development and you will often encounter breaking changes until the official Discord API is released.

It is highly recommended that you always use the latest version and please report any bugs you find to our `Discord chat`_.
