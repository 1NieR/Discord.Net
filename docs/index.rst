Discord.Net
===========

Discord.Net is an unofficial C# wrapper around the `Discord chat service`.
It offers several methods to create automated operations, bots, or even custom clients.

Feel free to chat with us in the `API Server on Discord`_.

Warning
-------

This is an alpha!

The Discord API is still in active development, meaning this library may break at any time without notice. 

Discord.Net itself is also in alpha so several functions may be unstable, untested, or not work at all.

Please report any bugs you find to our `Discord chat`_.
